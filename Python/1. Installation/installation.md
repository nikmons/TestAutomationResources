To get started with Python, download and install the latest version from the official [site][def]

> Be sure to select the "Add Python to environment variables" option during installation - It automatically appends the python binary location to the system's PATH environment variable.

After the installation is complete, check if python is enabled by running the following command in any shell (cmd, powershell, bash, etc)

```bash
$> python --version
```

An example of the output is:

```bash
Python 3.11.3
```

We can now proceed to the next chapter!
